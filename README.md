# indivisual - VJ-Synthesizer

## What is it? (Features/Antifeatures)
- YEAH BABY!!! indivisual - VJ-Synthesizer!!!
- ... more explanation here ...


## Things you have to know
indivisual VJ-Synthesizer works best and also is only developed on google-chrome.
I tried it on firefox but the performance is bad. 
Also i never tried it on another platform than linux (ubuntu & mint).

There is no clean code in here. There also is no explicit design pattern 
except a self designed plugin concept.

However i tried to cleanup and remove the messiest parts of it since i retired 
from my part time job as a VJ performing video life acts in some well known clubs in Munich.
I also retired from being a professional developer due to my inability 
to use popular programming techniques and design patterns.  

Therefore things do not work together perfectly sometimes.

But still it's pretty much fun to play with!

    This is a SSL warning. We can't use a public SSL certificate 
    but we have to use SSL to have microphone and audio input working. Therefore SSL hast to be enabled.
    Just click on the "Advanced" button and then on "Proceed to localhost (unsafe)".

### Samples & Sequences
- ... awesome ...
- Slow on GPUs but fast on INTEL's internal graphics cards
- Who could help me getting this into the GPU's memory -> contact me

### Shape-Editor
This feature is pretty crazy to use. But for some cases it does its job pretty well. Have a look at head.json or leaves.json in _____demos.

- In the controller, set shape_geometry to custom
- Open https://localhost:8081/setup.html
- Press S to enable shape controls

### MIDI Controllers
- If you own a Arturia Beatstep, simply connect it. If the device uses factory settings, it will work immediately and the layout will just work fine.
- Otherwise you have to build up your own layout. Have a look at [MidiController.yml](app/structure/MidiController.yml) 
- ... more explanation here ...  

### Plugins
indivisual comes with a set of funny plugins. Nevertheless you might want to extend it with some of your own ideas.
In this case you can add your own plugins for the most settings available.
